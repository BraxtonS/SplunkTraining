# SplunkTraining
Learning Splunk from the ground up and simulating real workplace functionality. 


<h2>Description</h2>
Being a cybersecurity professional comes with a steadily evolving toolset as time passes. In order to be proficient in this field, you always stay up to date and knowledgable on as many tools as you can. This has lead me to take up learning Splunk, which is an industry leading SIEM tool that delivers comprehensive visibility, empowers accurate detection, and fuels operational efficiency. I have learned my fair share of SIEM tools over the years wether it be during graduate school or at my current role for the state government, so it is only right to learn one of the most well known tools. In this part of the project I go through installing and configuring Splunk along with the Universal Forwarder, testing searches, grabbing sample data and plugging it into Splunk, and finally making my own test data to ingest and search using Splunk.
